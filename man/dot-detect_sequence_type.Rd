\title{Detect Sequence Type}
\usage{
.detect_sequence_type(seq, threshold = 0.9, max_len = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{seq}{A character string representing a single biological sequence.}

\item{threshold}{Proportion of characters that must be nucleotide-like (A, T, C, G, N, U, -) to classify the sequence as \code{"nucleotide"}. Default is 0.9.}

\item{max_len}{Maximum number of characters (from the start of the sequence) to consider when computing the proportion. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
A string: either \code{"nucleotide"} or \code{"protein"}.
}
\description{
Heuristically determines whether a given sequence is nucleotide or protein based on the proportion of standard nucleotide characters in the first \code{max_len} positions.
