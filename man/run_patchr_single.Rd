\arguments{
\item{msa}{A character matrix or list representing the multiple sequence alignment.}

\item{pdb}{A \code{bio3d} PDB object.}

\item{chain}{Optional chain ID to restrict structure analysis.}

\item{msa_path}{Optional path to a FASTA file if \code{msa} is not provided directly.}

\item{pdb_path}{Optional path to a PDB file if \code{pdb} is not provided directly.}

\item{patch.dist.cutoff}{Maximum distance (Å) for residues to be considered part of a patch.}

\item{patch.rsa.cutoff}{Minimum relative solvent accessibility for a residue to serve as a patch center.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{selection_df}{Residue-level data frame with nucleotide diversity, Tajima’s D, and haplotype diversity.}
\item{msa_info}{Reference and peptide info from \code{WRAPPER_msa_to_ref()}.}
\item{pdb_info}{Structure and patch data from \code{WRAPPER_pdb_to_patch()}.}
\item{nuc_info}{Codon mapping and patch-level MSAs from \code{WRAPPER_align_msa_pdb()}.}
}
\description{
Wrapper for full pipeline: loads alignment and structure, identifies patches, maps codons, and calculates selection statistics.
